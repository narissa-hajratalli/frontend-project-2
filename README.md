## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a full CRUD application to review different healthcare providers. The user will have the opportunity to report acts of discrimination they've experienced from providers through comments and those comments will be stored in a database and mapped to each provider. The inspiration for this appliaction is that People of Color are, statistically, overlooked by providers and experience discrimination in the healthcare industry.

For the frontend application, I plan to have a list of facts relating to discrimination in the healthcare industry. I also plan to have a dropdown menu containing provider's names and a "Submit a Complaint" button that allows the user to create a new comment. I will also have an button so that the user can only edit the entered provider's information (not their previous comment). Finally, there will be an option to delete a comment. The providers and their respective comments will appear in a list format.
